# discordapplication
Make a discord application bot for your needs! This bot will send an application to a user and once done, you may be able to view it! Currently in beta,

 - [Installation](https://github.com/Exo-OX1564/discordapplication/edit/main/README.md#installation)
   - The needed libraries.
 - [Setup](https://github.com/Exo-OX1564/discordapplication/edit/main/README.md#setup)
 - [Hosting 24/7 (Replit)](https://github.com/Exo-OX1564/discordapplication/edit/main/README.md#hosting-247-replit)
 - [Support](https://github.com/Exo-OX1564/discordapplication/edit/main/README.md#support)

### Installation
You need at least python 3.8 installed, I'm pretty sure 3.6 works too. If you are using replit, you are fine.
You will also need to import the following:
- discord
  - from discord.ext import commands
- time
  - from time import sleep

### Setup
To setup, install the needed libraries. Then insert your token in the appropriate spaces. Since I was using replit, I've added it to the 'Secrets Variable'.
Once done, let it setup and you're ready to go!

### Hosting 24/7 (Replit)

I suggest using [FreshPing](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/) since uptimerobot stopped some of replits monitors.
Copy the link you get from console as the web address when you start the bot, then signup for freshping and add that monitor. After all is setup, you're good to go!

### Support
While you do not need much support to setup this bot, if you need any help, open a pull request or DM me on **Exo#4313**. I will try to update this bot whenever I can, currently it is released on v0.1!
I will also update this after updating the bot for updates and fixes if needed.
